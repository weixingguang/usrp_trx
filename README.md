A program to transport and receive signals from usrp.

This project will be developed according to the following schedule:
	1. Transport a simple signal;
	2. Receive the specific signal;
	3. add some function to this basic usrp_trx project;

We will create three branches to this project, i.e.,master,develop and test.
The test branch is to do some basic test, while the develop branch is to add new function to this project and the master branch is to store the stable version.
